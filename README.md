## üìå Introduction

Conway's Game of Life is a famous cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It demonstrates how cells on a grid evolve across generations based on a set of mathematical rules.

This implementation is built with React, TypeScript, and styled-components, offering a responsive and interactive interface for visualizing the game's evolution.

## üéØ Purpose & Usage

The goal of this project is to:

- Explore functional and interactive UI design using React
- Learn and demonstrate state-driven animations
- Provide an engaging way to observe and manipulate cellular automata

### How to Use

1. Launch the app in your browser (locally or via deployment).
2. Start, pause, or reset the simulation.
3. Click on individual cells to toggle their state.
4. Observe how patterns evolve over time!
